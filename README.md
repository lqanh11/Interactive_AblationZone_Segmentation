# Interactive Ablation Zone Segmentation

This repository includes the necessary code and configuration files to replicate our work on ablation zone segmentation.

## System requirements
The source code is intended to run on a Linux workstation equipped with a GPU card.

## Dataset Preparation
In order to evaluate the performance of our framework, we utilize the [Liver Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) Zones Benchmark Dataset](https://graz.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/liver-radiofrequency-ablation-rfa-zones-benchmark-dataset). Please download the dataset and convert it to NIfTI format to conduct tests with our framework.
